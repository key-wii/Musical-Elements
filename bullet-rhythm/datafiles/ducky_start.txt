Hello

[Ducky2]
{
You do not possess the identity
or powers required to proclaim
the title of a holy being
}

[Ducky2]
{
sent unto the fabric of the
universe itself to create new
worlds and lifeforms
of all shapes and sizes
}

[Ducky2]
{
but I shall partake in the
consumption of the very
strands of life that define
your existence
}

[Ducky3]
{
in order to feed my ego
}

[Ducky2]
{
without any regard for
my safety,
well-being, and
special plated armor.
