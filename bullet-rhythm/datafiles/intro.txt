[Narrator]
{
Heheheh... hue hue hue... BWAHAHAH! 
}

[Narrator]
{
Oh! Hello there! Didn’t.. eh.. see you 
there! 
}

[Narrator]
{
What am I laughing at you ask? 
}

[Narrator]
{
Why, I’m just reading the Sunday paper’s 
comics! It has some funny stuff! 
}

[Narrator]
{
So.. eh.. why are you here again? 
}

[Narrator]
{
Oh yes, the video game! How could I have 
forgotten?
}

[Narrator]
{
Allow me to introduce myself, I am the 
narrator. Your reliable storyteller who sees and knows all! }

[Narrator]
{
Now… I think it's time to.. eh.. tell you a story!
}

[Narrator]
{
Now where to begin.. Oh yes!
}

[Narrator]
{
Ok, so there once was a man who lived in a shack in the woods.
}

The image depicts a sloppily drawn man next to a sloppoly drawn house.

[Narrator]
{
Oh come on, friend! Your imagination is better than that!
}

A fart sound plays followed by a sudden boost in the quality of the illustration. 

[Narrator]
{
There we are! He was so happy and friendly and by golly was all around just a good lad. Yes, look at him go!
}

The shot follows a short man in overalls as he walks through the woods. The scene is accompanied by silly music. 

[Narrator]
{
It is on this special day we will see him discover something that will change the course of history!
}

[Narrator]
{
What did he find you ask?
}

[Narrator]
{
A GRAND PIANO!
}

The music halts as the image shows a standard grand piano sitting alone in the forest.

[Narrator]
{
Oh come on… the piano looked cooler than that. It was magic after all.
}

The music swells as a reverberated fart sound turns the grand piano into The Grand Grand Piano. The piano was made of solid gold and was larger than before, adorned with grey flowers and black vines rolling down its facade. The elegant instrument was dimly lit with 5 candles, each with their own different colored flames.

[Narrator]
{
Behold the Grand Grand Piano! Look how beautiful it looks! 
}

[Narrator]
{
Our little hero approaches the piece, enamored by its holy presence. Look how it shines and shimmers in the dim forest light!
}

The little man approaches the piano, seemingly frightened by its presence.

[Narrator]
{
And now… as our little hero approaches… and lays a finger on a key. Ding!
}

The music swells once again as the little man’s overalls fly off his body, floating behind him.

[Narrator]
{
Come on, little friend. Strike the keys once more, and learn of your new found power!
}

The man plays the piano, as he presses the keys the overalls begin to dance. Kicking its pant legs and flaunting its straps, the overalls have come to life!

[Narrator]
{
Yes yes! Look how it moves! Look how it thrusts and sways with such beaming intention!
}

[Narrator]
{
Now my little friend… enough with the silly folly. Play us something a little more… EVIL!
}

[Narrator]
{
Our little friend plays a scary song, the piano keys sonically telling a tale of freaks and spooks. As he plays, the candle dressed with the red flame begins to spark and flicker.
}

[Narrator]
{
The overalls stop their silly dance, for what is happening now is not… very… silly. heheh.
}

The overalls burst into flames and begin shooting fiery projectiles

[Narrator]
{
Look at this! He has brought life to an inanimate item. Look how dangerous it is! Who knew a pair of overalls could be responsible for such destruction!
}

[Narrator]
{
Our little friend has developed powers beyond any mortal being’s comprehension!
}

[Narrator]
{
Now, ask yourself this my dearest player, if you were given the power to bring objects to life, to make them your divine beings of destruction and chaos, what would you do?!
}

[Narrator]
{
Go on, think for a second.
}

[Narrator]
{
Ok, let’s ask our little friend. Oh little friend!
}

The little man looks up to the sky

[Man]
{
Y- Yes?!
}

[Narrator]
{
You heard the question, yes?
}

[Man]
{
Y- Yes. I- I did.
}

[Narrator]
{
Well? What will you do!
}

[Man]
{
I-
}

[Narrator]
{
Yes?!
}

[Man]
{
I-
}

[Narrator]
{
Yes! Come on now, out with it!
}

[Man]
{
I wouldn't pay my taxes!
}

[Narrator]
{
Oh how vile! How devious! How truly wretched!
}

[Narrator]
{
Now some time passes and it becomes that special time of year where we all hop on our computers and file our taxes. Where is our little villain now?
}

[Narrator]
{
Ah yes, where his shack once sat he has erected a mega monument with his likeness engraved in its exterior.
}

[Narrator]
{
Atop this tower lies a horn, its shape allowing the sound of The Grand Grand Piano to be funneled all throughout his domain for all of his newly created subjects to hear.
}

[Narrator]
{
If you listen closely you can hear him play.
}

Faint chimes of a piano can be heard in the distance

[Narrator]
{
Now my friend.
}

[Narrator]
{
Yes you, the player. This is where you come in.
}

[Narrator]
{
Whenever there is evil in these fantasy worlds it is always your duty to stop it, correct?
}

[Narrator]
{
To be the player is to take the flame that burns with writhing wicked passion between your gamer fingers. To be the player is to squish the flame, to silence said passion.
}

[Narrator]
{
Who better to crush the souls of the innocent than a tax collector.
}

[Narrator]
{
This is your job now. May it be your unquenched thirst for fun that fuels your completion of the appointed goal that is collecting this vile creature’s taxes.
}

[Narrator]
{
Run along now. Go have some fun, player.
}
